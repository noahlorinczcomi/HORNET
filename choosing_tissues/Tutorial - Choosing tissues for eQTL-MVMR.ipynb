    "# Summary\n",
    "This brief tutorial shows you how to use the `tissue_chooser.py` tool to identify tissues that have the strongest eQTL signals for a set of your candidate genes. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tool uses GTEx v8 summary data (from https://https://gtexportal.org/) to estimate heritability scores for candidate genes across all available tissues. Tissues with the largest heritability scores for a gene are prioritized by the `tissue_chooser.py` tool. Tissues in which multiple candidate genes have relatively large heritability scores are prioritized over those in which a less candidate genes have the same magnitude of heritability scores. \n",

    "# Arguments\n",
    "The `tissue_chooser.py` tool takes 5 arguments:\n",
    "1. `--candidateGenes`, (Required) This can either be a comma-separated list of gene IDs or the path to a file (with extension) that contains one gene ID per row and no header.\n",
    "2. `--nTopTissues`, (Required) The number of top tissues to display. The default is 10. Note, if you put \"yes\" for `--saveAsFile`, all results will be written out, not just these that are printed.\n",
    "3. `--saveAsFile`, (Optional) If you would like the results to be saved to a file, put \"true\" or \"yes\", otherwise ignore this flag or put \"false\" or \"no\"\n",
    "4. `--outFilename`, (Optional) If you put \"true\" or \"yes\" for the `--saveAsFile` flag, you can specify the filename (without extension) of the output file here. The default is `tissue_results.txt`\n",
    "5. `--printResults`, (Optional) Please give this flag \"no\" if you do not want the results to be printed to the console. Note that if you give this a \"no\", you will want to make sure the results are saved in a file, otherwise you will never see the results. The default is to print results to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Genes given to the `--candidateGenes` flag can be formatted as gene names (e.g., *APOE*), Ensembl IDs (e.g., ENSG00000130203), or Ensembl IDs with version control (e.g., ENSG00000130203.9). \n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage examples\n",
    "Each of the below commands will print the results you want to the console."
